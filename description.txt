This mod attempts to add some of the ideas that I (Storm Diver Omega) have suggested on the forums, plus a bunch of new content I made up along the way.

This mod includes:

-35 New unique weapons
-12 new ammos
-New recipes for certain uncraftable vanilla items
-2 new bars and ore
-2 new accessories
-7 new buffs and 3 new potions
-6 new debuffs
-New armour and Vanity sets
-A new way to get the Rod of Discord :)
-Some new shop items
-New pets
-New enemies, including many Derplings

This mod also has some vanilla changes including:

-Buffed Ore armour stats and cheaper recipe
-Buffed Original Hardmode Ore armour defence
-Buffed Frost and Forbidden armours plus new recipe
-All Shroomite helmets buff all types of ranged damage, but you can still pick any of the three ;)
-Buffed Vortex and Solar flare armour
-New set bonuses for Copper, Iron, Silver, Gold, Rain, Eskimo and Obsidian armour
-Gladiator armour now a ranged set
-Mechanical souls recipes rebalanced
-Cheaper Super Healing potion Recipe

Also check the configuration options if you don't like modifications to vanilla items
