This mod attempts to add some of the ideas that I (Storm Diver Omega) have suggested on the forums, plus a bunch of new content I made up along the way.

This mod includes:

-39 New unique weapons
-12 new ammos
-New recipes for certain uncraftable vanilla items
-2 new bars and ore !WARNING if you created the world before installing this mod then the new ore will not spawn, but it will still drop from enemies in that biome and from crates!
-6 new accessories
-7 new buffs and 3 new potions
-6 new debuffs
-New armour and Vanity sets
-A new way to get the Rod of Discord :)
-Some new shop items
-2 new pets
-New enemies, including many Derplings
-A way to remove the shields from the pillars prematurely 

This mod also has some vanilla changes including:

-Buffed Ore armour stats and cheaper recipe
-Buffed Original Hardmode Ore armour defence
-Buffed Frost and Forbidden armours plus new recipe
-Buffed Vortex and Solar flare armour
-New set bonuses for Copper, Iron, Silver, Gold, Rain, Eskimo and Obsidian armour
-Gladiator armour now a ranged set
-Mechanical souls recipes rebalanced
-Cheaper Super Healing potion Recipe
