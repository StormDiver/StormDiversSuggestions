Storm Diver's Additions Mod is a smallish content mod made by one guy (@Storm Diver), that adds content throughout the entire game where it seemed that something was missing, along with unique items thrown in here and there

There's over 100 total modded items for you to discover; including weapons, accessories, ammo, tools, armour, vanity sets, enemies, and more. Many are crafted with vanilla items, but some have their own modded ingredients added to the recipes

It also has some vanilla tweaks to certain armour sets, plus there are some recipes changes along with new recipes for a few rare items that lacked one, which if you don't like you can always disable via the config menu

This mod is constantly updated, adding new content and tweaking existing, so join the server to keep up to date with all the additions and changes
